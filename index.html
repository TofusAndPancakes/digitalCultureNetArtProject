            When I was presented with the theme of upload-download, I remembered how I imagine the internet as a highway. We sent out a messenger from our computer to the complex routes of the internet. It made its way to its destination and sends a messenger with what we asked for, and we filter it through our toll booth, our firewall, security application and our own intuition, before it reaches our little city, our device. To add more context that the GIF is taking place in our device, we can see electric capacitors and RAM sticks as if we are in its motherboard. The highway in the GIF downloaded an image, entering the toll booth and uploaded an image, exiting the toll booth.  
            <br>
            <br>In a fast world where everything is easily obtainable, we need to remember the risks that comes with it. There are more cases where people innocently downloaded malicious files or access undesirable links which compromises their devices. This undesirable files or links are symbolized by this cat image. Despite being a wholesome image, its glitched, as if someone has hidden something malicious in it. It rushes with high speed towards the toll and we let it pass through the toll as we innocently assume it is simply an image.
            <br>
            <br>The malicious code soon run rampant and caused errors in the device. Imagery of cats started to appear and soon took “actual existence” in the system. The error afterwards caused the system to fail and it soon started an emergency boot. But it was too late and the device has become prey to the malicious Cat OS plague. Be wary of what you download but also upload. Do remember the impact of the files that you upload to others, like what happened to this unfortunate device.

            Christofer Alvin is an Indonesian hobbyist illustrator. At the start of high-school, he was inspired by the Indie game Oneshot which started his art journey. Over the years, he immersed himself in both pixel art and digital illustrations, making sprites, story and games with his colleagues and slowly honing his illustrations skills. 
            <br>
            <br> He has taken a liking to greyscale outlined-focused illustration style but is also interested in trying out new styles. He finds that when making illustrations, it is important to nail the mass of the object he is illustrating. He wants to play to the fact that drawings are just 3D illusions on a 2D flat plane. He always sticks to that principle when making illustrations and pixel art.
            <br>
            <br> On his free time, he still enjoys playing games, from FPS to single-player, watching Japanese animations, studying Japanese illustrator’s artworks, and drawing illustrations for fun.
